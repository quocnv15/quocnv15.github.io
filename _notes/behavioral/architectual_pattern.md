# Choosing Between Architectural Patterns in iOS Development

**SITUATION:**
In a solo project aimed at rapidly delivering an MVP, I had to decide on the best architecture to balance speed and maintainability.

**TASK:**
Choose an architectural pattern suitable for a small team (one developer) and an MVP timeline that keeps the codebase clean and modular enough to evolve later.

**ACTION:**
I considered the following:

- **Clean Architecture:**
    - Pros: Clear separation of concerns with layers (Presentation, Domain, Data).
    - Great for medium/large teams as each layer/component can be developed and tested independently.
    - Minimizes conflicts during parallel development and improves testability.
    - Cons: Initially more complex and slower to set up; might be overkill for solo rapid MVP.
- **MVVM:**
    - Pros: Good separation between UI and business logic with ViewModels.
    - Increases testability and modularity, helps in reactive UI updates (especially with Combine or RxSwift).
    - Suitable for teams and projects where UI complexity is moderate to high.
    - Cons: Adds some boilerplate and learning curve, slightly heavier than MVC.
- **MVC (enhanced):**
    - Pros: Simple and quick to implement, familiar in iOS community.
    - When used carefully (small, focused view controllers, separation of concerns), it is efficient for solo developers and MVPs.
    - Cons: Risk of Massive View Controllers if not disciplined; less ideal for long-term scalability or large teams.

Given this, I chose a well-structured MVC approach for the MVP, ensuring each class had a single responsibility, isolated business logic from UI code, and avoided bloated view controllers, applying clean principles informally.

**RESULT:**
This decision allowed me to quickly deliver an MVP with manageable, readable, and testable code. It offered room for future refactoring if the product scaled or the team grew.

**LESSONS LEARNED:**
Choosing architecture depends heavily on project context, team size, and timeline. Clean Architecture and MVVM bring robustness suited for collaboration and complex apps, while a disciplined MVC fits well for rapid solo development.
