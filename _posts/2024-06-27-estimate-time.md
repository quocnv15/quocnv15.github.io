# How do you estimate development time for a task?

## Why is this question important?
Time estimation is one of the most challenging tasks for developers, and how we approach task
estimation shows our experience.
Development time estimation is both a soft and hard skill.
On the one hand, it requires a broad technical knowledge of the development challenges and risks,
breaking them into smaller tasks and managing them.
On the other hand, we need good communication skills to work with other teammates, excellent time
management skills, and the ability to analyze dependencies that can affect our schedule.
After all, we chose to develop professional iOS applications, and that’s a complex job to do…
## What is the answer?
The answer is similar to the previous answer about the project timeline. The difference is that in task
estimation, it is simpler to get into the small details and understand the risks.
Let’s go over the list of the stages we need to go through:
1. Understand the requirements.
2. Break them down into small sub-tasks.
3. Assess the complexity of each sub-task, and consider any potential risks and challenges. If needed,
research such risks or even create a POC to understand.
4. Consider dependencies to make sure we are not blocked from moving forward with our
development process.
5. Add more time for reviewing and refining the results.
I think that point number three is perhaps the most important. When a development task doesn’t
meet its estimation goals, it is primarily because of risks we didn’t consider. It is hard to go wrong
when setting up a standard user interface (UI) screen, but the unknown issues are what make our
task overdue.
