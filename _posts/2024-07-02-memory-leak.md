# How to debug memory leaks in iOS applications?

## Why is this question important?
First, let’s be aligned on what a memory leak is. A memory leak doesn’t mean an app with high memory
usage – that’s a widespread misconception.
A memory leak means an app was allocated memory for something and then stopped using it, but
the memory space wasn’t released.
The result might be high memory usage, but increased memory usage does not indicate a memory leak.
Memory leaks are hard to debug but point to inefficient resource consumption and can lead to app
termination. That’s why memory leak debugging is an important topic in iOS development.
## What is the answer?
Having said that, memory leaks are hard to debug. Fortunately, there are many ways to solve this:
1. Instruments: Instruments is a powerful tool that comes with Xcode that can help us profile
different aspects of our app, including memory allocations and leaks. It’s an advanced tool that
can profile a specific object, log its retains/release operations, and even direct us to a particular
location in our code base.
2. Memory graph debugging: It’s a relatively new feature, and not many are aware of it yet. Using
memory graph debugging, it is possible to stop the run at any point and look at the live objects
list and the relationships between them. It can also highlight what it identifies as a memory
leak and points to the reason.
3. NSZombie: NSZombie is a tool that lets us detect and track elements before they are deallocated.
4. The deinit function: In certain cases, we can put a print statement or a breakpoint in the
object’s deinit() function. The deinit() function gets called just before the object is
deallocated. That’s a nice and simple way to see whether an object leaks without launching
external and heavy tools.
5. Memory gauge: We can use Xcode’s memory gauge regularly to see whether memory is being
deallocated and doesn’t grow constantly. It’s a great sign we should investigate the issue further
using the other tools on the list.
As we can see, there are plenty of methods and tools to debug memory leaks in iOS. Some are there
to monitor our memory consumption, and some are very advanced and help detect precisely where
and when the leak occurs. The combination of the tools provides us with the perfect toolset to track
and fix memory leaks.
