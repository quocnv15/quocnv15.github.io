# How do you create a technical design document for an iOS task?

## Why is this question important?
This is a question that continues from the previous two. We started with project planning and task
time estimation, and now we are trying to understand how to design a single development task.
Technical document creation encapsulates our expertise in approaching a technical task. Even if we
don’t usually write technical documents, the process of designing a feature from a technical point of
view is crucial for developers.
Put aside the suggested answer – try to go over technical documents you’ve used in the past and
retrieve what the process that led to this output was. Bringing your own experience to the table is the
best answer because it will be easier to explain.
## What is the answer?
A technical document contains the following topics: introduction, requirements, architecture, flows,
data model, testing, and deployment.
These are the following steps to create it:
1. Plan and research: Collect information about the project, including requirements and constraints.
2. Outline the document: Write the sections and sub-sections to ensure we are not missing any important topic.
3. Describe the requirements: Specify requirements in detail.
4. Discuss the system architecture: Describe the system architecture in detail. Write down the different layers involved in the feature.
5. Define the data model: Describe the entities and the different API calls.
6. Specify the user interface: Include screens, UI components, and navigation flows.
7. Outline the testing strategy: Include types of testing, tools, and goals.
8. Discuss the deployment process: Include beta rollout, A/B testing, and app versions.
It’s important to say that most, if not all, of the steps I detailed are not explicitly related to Swift – this
is one of the good things about this question. Planning is a language and platform-agnostic task, and
you can find plenty of people that can help you understand how to approach a technical document
design even if you haven’t done one before.
