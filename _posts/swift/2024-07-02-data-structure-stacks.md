# Elementary Data Structures - Stacks

## Stack operations
Stacks are useful and also exceedingly simple. The main goal of building a stack is to enforce how you access your data.
There are only two essential operations for a stack: • push: Adding an element to the top of the stack. • pop: Removing the top element of the stack.
Limiting the interface to these two operations means that you can only add or remove elements from one side of the data structure. In computer science, a stack is known as a LIFO (last-in-first-out) data structure. Elements that are pushed in last are the first ones to be popped out.
Stacks are used prominently in all disciplines of programming. To list a few:
• iOS uses the navigation stack to push and pop view controllers into and out of view.
• Memory allocation uses stacks at the architectural level. Memory for local variables is also managed using a stack.
• Search and conquer algorithms, such as finding a path out of a maze, use stacks to facilitate backtracking.
