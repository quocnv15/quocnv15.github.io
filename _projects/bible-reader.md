## Project Overview

Bible Reader is a comprehensive audio Bible application designed to provide users with an immersive spiritual experience through synchronized audio and text content. As a solo developer, I created this app to enable users to listen to Bible passages while following along with highlighted text, with robust offline capabilities.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Pattern
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Traditional iOS architecture
- **Audio Focus Management**: Proper handling of system audio sessions
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage for user preferences and downloads
- **Network Layer**: Robust error handling for streaming content

### Core Technologies

#### Audio Management
- **AVPlayer**: Core audio playback functionality
- **AVPlayerItem**: Individual audio track management
- **AVPlayerLayer**: Audio visualization and progress tracking
- **Audio Session**: System audio integration and interruption handling

#### Data Management
- **Realm**: Local database for bookmarks, history, and user data
- **Core Data**: Cache management for downloaded content
- **FileManager**: Local file storage for offline audio
- **UserDefaults**: App settings and user preferences

#### Networking & Communication
- **Alamofire**: HTTP networking for content delivery
- **URLSession**: Background download tasks
- **Reachability**: Network connectivity monitoring
- **RxSwift**: Reactive programming for async operations

## Development Challenges

### Challenge: Audio-Text Synchronization
**Solution**: Implemented precise timing mechanisms using AVPlayer's time-based events and custom synchronization algorithms to ensure text highlighting matches audio playback perfectly.

### Challenge: Large File Downloads
**Solution**: Developed background download tasks with resume capabilities, chunked downloading, and robust error handling to handle large audio files efficiently.

### Challenge: Offline Content Management
**Solution**: Created sophisticated file management system with intelligent caching, storage optimization, and seamless online/offline transitions.
